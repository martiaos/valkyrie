# Valkyrie
Valkyrie is a PySimpleGUI initiative tracker for D&amp;D 5th Edition.

It's currently a work in progress. A slow, tedious progress.

## Etymology

Why Valkyrie? Valkyries - the divine shield-maidens of Norse mythology - watch over the battlefields, guiding the worthy who fall to the feasting halls of Valhalla.


## Todo list:
 Next up:

*   Implement enemy templates
*   Implement exporting of battle status to file, for players, enemies or everyone
*   Implement initiative tracker; manual adding of players + autoroll for enemies
